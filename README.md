# Dice-Simulator

## Overview
I built this simple Dice Simulator using Python's Tkinter library for the GUI and Pygame library to add on the sound effects. The application simulates the rolling of a six-sided die, displaying the result both numerically and visually with corresponding images. Additionally, I implemented a random dice rolling sound which is played each time the dice is rolled.


## Requirements
* Python 3
* Tkinter library
* PIL (Pillow) library
* Pygame library


## Installation
Install the required libraries using pip.

Ensure you have downloaded the necessary dice images and sound files.


## Usage
Place all the required images and sound files in the same directory as the script.

**Run** the script.


## Assets

All dice face images were made by me in Adobe Illustrator.

All rolling sound files were downloaded using Pixabay.


## Notes
Ensure the image and sound files are named correctly and placed in the correct directory.

Modify the image size and window dimensions if needed to fit your display preferences.
